# Youth Sports League Analytics Dashboard - Senior Web Engineer Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to evaluate your skills as a senior web application engineer. You will build a React application that visualizes information about a local youth sports league using modern web development practices and infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy on AWS.

## Assignment Details

### Task
Create a responsive web application that displays analytics and visualizations for a youth sports league. The application should:

1. Display league statistics and player performance metrics
2. Visualize team standings and game results
3. Show player attendance and participation trends
4. Include a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Use of React hooks and functional components
- State management solution (Redux Toolkit, Context API, or similar)
- Responsive design using modern CSS approaches (CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, etc.)
- Data visualization using a library of your choice (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Recharts)
- Unit and integration tests

#### Backend/Infrastructure
- Infrastructure as Code using one of:
  - AWS CDK (preferred)
  - AWS CloudFormation
  - AWS SAM
  - Terraform
- API for data retrieval and processing
- Data storage solution capable of handling millions of records

### Data
Sample data is provided in the `data` directory. This represents a subset of the data your application should be able to handle. Your solution should be designed to scale to process millions of rows of data daily.

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Complete source code for the React application
2. **Infrastructure Code**: IaC templates/code for AWS deployment
3. **Documentation**:
   - Documentation about why you made the frontend choices you did in your source code
   - Architecture diagram and explanation
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Scaling considerations for handling millions of rows of data
   - Setup and deployment instructions
   - Future enhancement recommendations

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on code quality, architecture design, performance optimization, documentation clarity, UI/UX design, and test coverage.

We value your approach to problem-solving over completeness; document any unimplemented features or components with your intended implementation strategy and assumptions made when requirements were unclear. We know that time is limited! 

## Time Expectation

This assignment is designed to take approximately 2-3 hours for a skilled senior engineer.

## Submission

Please submit your solution as a Git repository (can be a public Github repo) with all necessary code and documentation.


Good luck!
